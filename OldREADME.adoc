Algebraic data types (ADTs) were introduced in Hope, a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh.

*Algebraic* refers to the property that an ADT is created by algebraic operations. The algebra here, is *_sums_*, *_products_* and *_patterns_*:

*sum*:: alternation (for three values A, B, C → A or B or C but not any combination or other subset).
*product*:: combination (for three values A, B, C → A and B and C, possible to hold empty for one or more).

Algebraic data types are also known as *_composite types_* - a type formed by combining other types.

Algebraic data types (ADTs) can be identified and analyzed using *_Pattern Matching_*.

== A deeper look at Sum and Product types

Let us look at the two common types: sum types and product types.

=== Values of algebraic types

.Deeper look at the algebraic data types
[cols="3*^.^"]
|===
||Sum Types | Product Types

| Use
| Define variants
| Hold Values

| Logic
| Logical OR operation (only one of the variants is possible)
| Logical AND operation (combination of several values)

| Content
| Each variant can have its own constructor with specified number of arguments
| Contains several values of possibly different types themselves

.4+| Examples

| `Enums` (additional data cannot be associated with an enum, once created)
| `Class`

| `Optional`
| Tuple (developer created/third party libraries)

| `Sealed` types
| `Records` (Java 14,15) Java 16

|
| `Visitor`
