Algebraic data types (ADTs) were introduced in *_Hope_* +

==== Algebra
*Algebraic* refers to the property that an ADT is created by algebraic operations.

Algebraic data types are also known as *_composite types_* - a type formed by combining other types.

Algebraic data types (ADTs) can be identified and analyzed using *_Pattern Matching_*.
