* Record classes (JEP 395) are transparent carriers for data

* Code receiving an instance of a record class typically extracts the data, known as the components.

* use a type pattern to test whether a value is an instance of the record class Point _and_ +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} _if so_, extract the `x` and `y` components from the value:

[source, java, line, linenums, highlight=6..8]
----
record Point(int x, int y) {}

. . .

static void printSum(Object o) {
    if (o instanceof Point p) {          //<1>
        int x = p.x();
        int y = p.y();
        System.out.println(x+y);
    }
}
----
<1> The variable `p` is somewhat redundant ‚Äî it is used solely to invoke the accessor methods `x()` and `y()`
