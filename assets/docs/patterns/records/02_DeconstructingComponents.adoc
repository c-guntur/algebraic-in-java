record Point(int x, int y) {}
. . .
void printSum(Object o) {
    if (o instanceof Point(int x, int y)) {      //<1>
        System.out.println(x + y);
    }
}
----
<1> A Point is deconstructed into its components `x` and `y`.

In effect, a *record pattern* disaggregates an instance of a record into its components.

[NOTE]
Variable names are only introduced for the components `x` and `y`, not for the Point `p` itself. +
