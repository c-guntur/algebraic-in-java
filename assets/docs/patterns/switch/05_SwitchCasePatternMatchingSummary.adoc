= image:../../../images/Switch.png[Switch, 35, 35] Pattern Matching  for `switch` - `case`
:icons: font

Two new pattern matching possibilities have been discussed:

Primary Pattern:: A `Type Pattern` to declare and provide a variable via the `instanceof`.

Guarded Pattern:: A combination of a `Primary Pattern` && `Conditional Expression`
* A *guarded pattern* is of the form `p && e`, +
    where `p` is a pattern and `e` is a boolean expression.
* In a guarded pattern any local variable, formal parameter, or exceptional parameter that is: +
    _used but not declared in the subexpression_, must either be *final* or *effectively final*.
* A guarded pattern is *_flow-sensitive_*, failure of the first part should prevent execution of the second.
