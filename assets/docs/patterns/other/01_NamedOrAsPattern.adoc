= image:../../../images/OtherDetails.png["Other Details", 35, 35] Named Arrays and Record Patterns
:icons: font

* Record and array patterns provide a way to deconstruct the value +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} - they do not *_yet_* provide a means to also name the value being deconstructed.

* Some languages introduce a new pattern form, commonly referred to as an *as pattern* +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} - specifically to allow a value being deconstructed to be named.

* There _may_ be a future addition of a similar feature in Java.
