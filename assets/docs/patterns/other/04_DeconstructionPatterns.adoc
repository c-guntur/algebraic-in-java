:icons: font


* Record patterns disaggregate the values of a record type.

* It _may_ be possible to eventually to support this feature for all classes, not just record classes.

* Such general disaggregation is termed as *deconstruction*, to suggest its duality with the process of construction.

* For a general class this will possibly require the explicit declaration of a deconstruction pattern to describe how an instance of the class can be deconstructed.
