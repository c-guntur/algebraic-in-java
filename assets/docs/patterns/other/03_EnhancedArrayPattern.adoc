= image:../../../images/OtherDetails.png["Other Details", 35, 35] Enhanced Array Patterns
:icons: font

* Imagine matching a `String` array, where we are only interested in the *eighth* and *ninth* elements of the array.

* The pattern would look like:

[source, java, line, linenums]
----
String[]{ var s1, var s2, var s3, var s4, var s5, var s6, var s7, var eighth, var ninth, ... }
----
* In this method, the pattern variable `y` is completely redundant.

* Some sort of index-based component pattern would be more useful in this case

* What may be possible:

[source, java, line, linenums]
----
String[] { [8] -> var eighth, [9] -> var ninth}
----
