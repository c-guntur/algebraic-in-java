= image:../../../images/OtherDetails.png["Other Details", 35, 35] Don't Care Patterns
:icons: font

* Often there are components of a structured object for which we do not want to explicitly declare pattern variables.

[source, java, line, linenums]
----
void int getXfromPoint(Object o) {

    if (o instanceof Point(var x, var y)){           //<1>
        return x;
    }
    return -1;
}
----
<1> In this method, the pattern variable `y` is completely redundant.


* Proposals suggest that Java use the +_+ symbol to denote parameters that need not be named +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} - one possible extension would be to allow patterns such as `Point(var x, var _)`.

* However, it might be possible to remove the `var`, or add syntactic sugar for `var` +_+.
