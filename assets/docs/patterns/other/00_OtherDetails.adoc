== Future Possibilities

=== Named record and array patterns

Both record and array patterns provide a way to deconstruct the value, but they do not provide a means to also name the value being deconstructed.

Some languages introduce a new pattern form, commonly referred to as an *as pattern*, specifically to allow a value being deconstructed to be named.

=== Don't-care patterns
Often there are components of a structured object for which we do not want to explicitly declare pattern variables. For example:

[source, java, line, linenums]
----
void int getXfromPoint(Object o) {

    if (o instanceof Point(var x, var y)){
        return x;
    }
    return -1;
}
----
In this method, the pattern variable `y` is completely redundant. Proposals suggest that Java use the +_+ symbol to denote parameters that need not be named, so one possible extension would be to allow patterns such as `Point(var x, var _)`. However, it might be possible to remove the `var`, or add syntactic sugar for `var` +_+.

=== Enhanced array patterns
As an example to understand this, imagine matching a `String` array, where we are only interested in the *eighth* and *ninth* elements of the array. Currently, the pattern would be something like `String[]{ var dummy1, var dummy2, var dummy3, var dummy4, var dummy5, var dummy6, var dummy7, var eightElement, var ninthElement, ... }` which is quite cumbersome. Some sort of index-based component pattern would be more useful in this case, e.g. `String[] { [8] -> var eighthElement, [9] -> var ninthElement}`.

=== Deconstruction patterns
Record patterns disaggregate the values of a record type. The hope is eventually to support this feature for all classes, not just record classes. Such general disaggregation is termed as deconstruction, to suggest its duality with the process of construction.

For a record class it is obvious how an instance can be deconstructed. For a general class this will require the explicit declaration of a deconstruction pattern to describe how an instance of the class can be deconstructed.
