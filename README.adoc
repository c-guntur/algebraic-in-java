Algebraic data types were introduced in Hope, a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh.

*Algebraic* refers to the property that an Algebraic Data Type is created by algebraic operations. The algebra here, is *_sums_* and *_products_*:

*sum*:: alternation (A | B, meaning A or B but not both)
*product*:: combination (A B, meaning A and B together)

Algebraic data types are also known as *_composite types_* - a type formed by combining other types

== A deeper look at Sum and Product types

Let us look at the two common types: product types (value holders) and sum types (variant types).

=== Values of algebraic types

.Deeper look at the algebraic data types
[cols="3*^.^"]
|===
||Sum Types | Product Types

| Use
| Define variants
| Hold Values

| Logic
| Logical OR operation (only one of the variants is possible)
| Logical AND operation (combination of several values)

| Content
| Each variant can have its own constructor with specified number of arguments
| Contains several values of possibly different types themselves

| Special examples
| Enums (Enumerations) are a special sum type with a zero-argument constructor
| Recursive types are a special product type

.4+| Other examples

| `Enums` (additional data cannot be associated with an enum, once created)
| `Class`

| `Optional`
| Tuple (developer created/third party libraries)

| `Sealed` types
| `Records` (Java 14,15) Java 16

|
| `Visitor`
